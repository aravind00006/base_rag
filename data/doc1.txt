Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a broad field of computer science focused on building systems that can perform tasks requiring human intelligence. These tasks include reasoning, problem-solving, perception, language understanding, and decision-making.

Modern AI systems are largely data-driven and rely on statistical models rather than explicit rules. Machine learning is a major subfield of AI, where models learn patterns from data instead of being manually programmed.

Large Language Models (LLMs) are a recent advancement in AI that can understand and generate human-like text. They are trained on massive datasets and use transformer architectures based on attention mechanisms.

However, LLMs do not truly understand information. They generate responses based on probability, which can lead to hallucinations — confident but incorrect answers. This limitation is a key reason why techniques like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) are used.

AI systems are powerful but must be carefully designed, evaluated, and constrained to ensure reliability, correctness, and safety in real-world applications.
